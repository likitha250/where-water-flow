# 🌊 Where The Water Flows

**Where The Water Flows** is a **2D puzzle–adventure game** developed using the **Godot Engine** for **GitHub Game Off 2025 (Theme: Waves)**.  
The game focuses on water-based mechanics, environmental puzzles, and smooth exploration gameplay.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

- **Genre:** Puzzle / Adventure  
- **Engine:** Godot (2D)  
- **Theme:** Waves, water flow, and environmental interaction  
- **Platform:** PC (Godot export supported)

Players interact with floating platforms, switches, elevators, and water-driven mechanics to progress through multiple handcrafted levels.

## ✨ Features

- Water-based puzzle mechanics
- Floating platforms and objects
- Multiple interactive levels
- Smooth camera movement
- Ambient music and sound effects
- Pixel-art visual style
- Custom shaders for water effects

---

## 🧠 Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Water Flow Interaction** – Objects react dynamically to water height and direction  
- **Switches & Pressure Plates** – Unlock paths and activate mechanisms  
- **Floating Objects** – Logs, platforms, and items float based on physics logic  
- **Environmental Puzzles** – Use the environment creatively to progress
